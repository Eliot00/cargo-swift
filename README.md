> A cargo plugin to easily build Swift packages from Rust code

It provides interactive commands for initializing and packaging a Rust library as Swift Package for usage in iOS and macOS apps.

This plugin heavily builds on [swift-bridge](https://github.com/chinedufn/swift-bridge), so if you like the bridging magic between Swift and Rust, check out swift-bridge!
